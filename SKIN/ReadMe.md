# Paper Title:
Automated model discovery for skin: Discovering the best model, data, and experiment

# Data organisation:

## Python-scripts:

CANN4Skin_main.py: Main file used to train and evaluate the model, reads and processes data and plots results

ModelsSkin_p.py: Main model definitions and architecture proposed in the paper

PlotSkin_p.py: All plotting routines used to plot the results

\data\NODE_porcine_skin_data_1.csv: Used biaxial data sets

\Results\Model_p: All trained model data 
R2 data are given in .csv and .txt files and are used in the main paper

\Results\Model_p\1 - 5: Models trained on single loading paths

\Results\Model_p\all: Model data trained on all loading paths
