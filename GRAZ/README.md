# Input: brain data, same as in \BRAIN
Uniaxial tension/compression and simple shear data for the cortext, corona radiata, corpus callosum, basal ganglia.

# Instructions
1. Download `input` folder and `BrainCANN.ipynb` and upload them to your Google Drive account
2. Change the `path` variable in the third code block to direct to where you put these files
3. Run the code blocks sequentially

# Debugging Common Issues
1. Make sure you are using the correct matplotlib and tensorflow versions by running the second code block where you can check the versions. After you run `!pip install ...` you first need to restart the runtime (runtime > restart runtime) and then import the packages. 
2. Make sure all the code blocks have been checked; missing one would prevent the code from running.

# Common Questions
Q. Do I need to install anything? \\
A. No, Google Colab is a cloud-based computing platform that is free to use with a Google account. Python and many common packages come pre-installed.
