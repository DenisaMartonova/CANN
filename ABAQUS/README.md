please cite our paper above!**

> This repository is organized as follows:  
> /DATA contains the original experimental data used to autonomously learn the constitutive artifical neural network model for gray and white brain matter tissue  
> /INPUT/HEXcube contains the hexahedral cube benchmark simulation files  
> /INPUT/BRAINslices contains the brain slice simulation files  
> /SUBROUTINE contains the raw fortran universal uanisohyper subroutine, as well as a Windows/Abaqus2022 pre-compiled subroutine for users working on a system without a Fortran compiler installed
